    linked measurements: null # FTIR, SXRD, Ring Disc - indicate if any other operando methods were shown in the same plot, which is linked to the data
    comment: # Add whatever you think is important to understand the data. This will be updated by the `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV` module and takes the comment from the svg file.
